Pypr 0.1.0

Welcome! To open the source for a Python module, choose "Pypr: Open Python 3
module" or "Pypr: Open Python 2 module" from the Command Palette.

Pypr will prompt you for a package/module name and attempt to use the python3
or python2 executable on your PATH to find an importable package by that name.

A workaround for the OS X PATH issue (environment not being set if ST3 is not
started with 'subl') is included.

Pypr 0.1.0 is still in early development and is not tested cross-platform.

If you have any problems please raise an issue at:
